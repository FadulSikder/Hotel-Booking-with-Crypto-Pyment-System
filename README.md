# Hotel-Booking-with-Crypto-Pyment-System

**Description:**

The project aims to emulate a hotel booking system using a crypto payment system(Etherium). A couple of different technologies came together to build this project. The project's front end was built using React framework and node.js runtime environment. The back end has a solidity contract deployed in Ganache and Ropsten test network. Web3.js is used to build the API between the front end and back end. Finally, the Truffle development environment and testing framework have been used to build the whole project. Using this Defi application, one can use a MetaMask wallet to book a hotel room using Ether.
